# 📊 LeetCode Profile Stats Viewer

A full-stack web application that fetches and displays detailed statistics and profiles of LeetCode users. This project utilizes the LeetCode GraphQL API to gather comprehensive user data and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface with data visualizations. 🚀

## ✨ Features

-   **👤 User Profile Search:** Find any LeetCode user by their username.
-   **📈 Comprehensive Statistics:** View a wide array of stats, including:
    -   Total problems solved and acceptance rate.
    -   Breakdown of solved problems by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    -   Ranking and reputation points.
    -   Social links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
-   **🎨 Data Visualizations:**
    -   An interactive pie chart to visualize the user's acceptance rate.
    -   A bar chart showing the number of questions solved for each difficulty level.
-   **💻 Language Proficiency:** See a list of programming languages used and the number of problems solved in each.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

###  Frontend

-   **⚛️ React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **⚡ Vite:** A modern frontend build tool.
-   **🗺️ React Router:** For declarative routing in the React application.

-   npm or yarn

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/uditc0derr/LeetCodeProfilExt.git](https://github.com/uditc0derr/LeetCodeProfilExt.git)
    cd LeetCodeProfilExt
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend

    ```

### ▶️ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

##  GraphQL Usage

The backend service acts as a proxy and data aggregator for the official LeetCode GraphQL API. It constructs and sends queries to fetch specific data points about a user.

The GraphQL queries are defined in `backend/src/config/graphqlQueries.js` and cover the following data scopes:
-   `userPublicProfile`: Fetches general profile information like real name, ranking, avatar, and social links.
-   `userProblemsSolved`: Retrieves statistics on solved problems, submission counts, and acceptance rates broken down by difficulty.
-   `skillStats`: Gathers information about problems solved across different skill tags (e.g., advanced, intermediate).
-   `languageStats`: Fetches the count of problems solved for each programming language.

These queries are then sent from the `leetcodeService.js` to the LeetCode GraphQL endpoint (`https://leetcode.com/graphql`).
